Come on everybody!
Clap your hands!
All you looking good!
I'm goona sing my song
It won't take long!
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this:
Come on let's twist again,
Like we did last summer!
Yeaaah, let's twist again,
Like we did last year!
Do you remember when,
Things were really hummin',
Yeaaaah, let's twist again,
Twistin' time is here!
